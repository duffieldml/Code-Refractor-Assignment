# Code-Refractor-Assignment

I started this project to fix the website's functionality and consolidate the css. These objectives were achieved.

I also went through the css style sheet and added comments to each portion of the code. Now it will tell you what each section of code pertains to and controls.

The html code has also been reworked slightly and formatted. It is much easier to navigate and see each section of code.
